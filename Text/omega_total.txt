monitor[-1] ## My overall experience with this monitor was very poor.
monitor[-1], picture quality[-1] ## I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .
screen[-1] ## A week out of the box and I began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time , growing more frequent each day .
Display[-1] ## Display glitches and flashes also occurred .
monitor[-1] ## I could tell this was a `` cheap '' monitor as soon as I set it up .
monitor[-1], colors[-1] ## I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .
speakers[-1], monitor[-1] ## The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...
clicker[-1], mouse pad[-1] ## The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .
run[-1][v] ## I 've been playing Minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time , and while it does run slower while multi-tasking , the gaming experience is not compromised for me .
direct Elictrical connectivity[-1], connect[-1][v] ## My comments are as follow : 1 - Does n't have direct Elictrical connectivity -LRB- you need Adapter which is comming with the package -RRB- 2 - It is really very difficult to connect the the power Cable & the regular -LRB- VGA -RRB- PC connection .
price[-1] ## One last note , I purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states .
backlight[-1] ## The backlight will periodically fail , the first time it happened I sent it in for warranty repair .
Acer[-1] ## Acer has been awful to deal with , they treat their customers like rubbish , and have a miserable repair facility to match their products .
monitor[-1] ## Don't buy this monitor !
slow[-1][a], system[-1] ## I felt the system was slow so I purchased a 4gb ram from crucell and replaced the standard 2gb that came with the system .
monitor[+1], price[+1], cable hook ups[-1][v] ## Nice monitor for price but I agree with other customer review about difficulty of cable hook ups .
video cable[+1], fit into the socket[-1][v] ## First gripe : I set up a lot of these puppies , and the video cable does n't always fit into the socket on the underside of the monitor .
monitors[-1] ## Second gripe : In the 6 or so months since we purchased our batch of 30-40 of these monitors , 2 have already been returned for repair or replacement .
monitors[-1] ## Third gripe : These monitors can suffer from the LCD equivalent of screen burn - `` image persistence '' if you like .
widescreen monitors[-1] ## Besides , I hate widescreen monitors !!!!
switches[-1] ## When it works its fine but I have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches .
stand[-1] ## My other big complaint about this monitor is the stand .
monitor[-1] ## It 's flimsy plastic and the monitor bounces around while you type .
height adjustability[-1] ## There 's also no height adjustability , so it sits very low to the desk .
keyboard[-1] ## There is one very annoying problem with this model though : the keyboard is `` sticky '' - meaning , despite this tablet is brand new and just arrived , when I press and release a key on the keyboard it acts as if I kept it pressed , continuing to type the same character again and again .
stand[-1], monitor[-1] ## The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .
monitor[-1] ## It will only move the monitor side to side -LRB- no up\/down or tilt feature -RRB- .
monitor[-1] ## Maybe some of you do n't have this problem , but I know of over 20 cases of buzzing from this monitor .
monitor[-1] ## I sent my monitor in to Acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random Buzzing from my Acer GD235Hz monitor .
chat support[-1], repair technicians[-1] ## You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .
repair technicians[-1] ## You guys need to hire new repair technicians because the ones that are in the repair center obviously have no idea what they are doing .
image quality[-1] ## If you are not picky about image quality , go for it .
beeps[-1][v] ## However , when you unplug the computer it beeps .
computer[+1], customer service[-1] ## Wonderful computer , horrible customer service , and I may be deaf come next year .
customer service[-1] ## Would n't buy again because of the customer service .
keyboard connector[-1] ## While upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke .
switch[-1] ## The replacement unit had a problem too : the little switch on the bottom was n't working properly , making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area .
colors[-1], brightness[-1] ## I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .
viewing angles[-1] ## Others may have better luck , but I have never seen a flat-panel with such horrible viewing angles .
instructions[-1] ## I have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it , just a crude pictorial instruction of installation , which leaves a great deal of information missing .
video card[-1] ## The problems came from my video card .
price[-1] ## I hesitated for so long because of the price .
incompatibility[-1] ## My only grips are the incompatibility with XP and the USB hub in the display .
router[-1], hang[-1][v] ## Sometimes the system would hang , so I would have to restart the router , then get going again .
tall[-1][a] ## It is tall , so I ended up laying it on its side .
dsl modem[-1] ## -LRB- yeah , like you 'll use a new , very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge -RRB- I returned the Item and got a linksys dsl modem instead .
D-link[-1] ## When I bought the third one , I thought I can give D-link one more try , but now I regret my decision .
data rate[-1] ## The data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but I only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much .
SLOW[-1][a] ## I started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely SLOW .
USB function[-1] ## Bottom Line - Do n't buy this for the USB function .
router[-1] ## Addition on 4\/14\/2011 \*\*\* I 've just had the 2nd router of this model go bad inside of 5 months .
reset[-1][v] ## Last night I needed to reset the router .
power supply[-1] ## I unplugged it , plugged it back in , and the power supply failed .
model router[-1] ## This model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned .
firmware upgrade[-1] ## halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar , the infamous browser `` Page not found '' screen replaced most of the router 's interface .
network[-1], Internet connection[-1], router[-1] ## The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .
router[-1] ## After that , the router would never even respond to its own internal browser link .
security settings[-1] ## My only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and I am not sure why ; do n't know if it was something that I did or if it was a malfunction of the router .
Range[-1] ## Range was comparable to , or possibly slightly worse than the old Linksys router I had been using for years .
router[-1] ## And finally , in early June , this router stopped broadcasting an internet signal .
internet signal[-1] ## The internal network still functioned , but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem .
connect[-1][v] ## I bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless N speeds .
service tech[-1] ## They caused the problem , ie wrong product in the box , the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong .
disconnect[-1][v] ## This router gets 1 star from me due to it 's disconnect issue .
price[-1], quality[-1] ## Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .
warranty[-1] ## I guess that `` limited lifetime warranty '' means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty .
connect[-1][v] ## I spent 4 hours on that and I could n't connect to the internet .
plug[-1] ## Especially due to the odd sized plug designed by D-Link .
size[-1] ## No one sells a 1.2 mm x 2.2 mm sized -LRB- or what ever stupid size it is -RRB- power adapter .
reboots[-1][v] ## The problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour , if not more frequently .
come back online[-1][v] ## It takes approximately 20 to 90 seconds to come back online -LRB- I have n't timed it -RRB- , which does n't sound that bad until you get nailed 10 times in one hour -LRB- that 's about as bad as it gets ; sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting -RRB- .
signal strength[-1] ## Unfortunately my Verizon 3G signal strength where I live is very weak -LRB- 1-2 bars -RRB- so I could n't get much more than 1 Mbps download speed but I will test this again when I am in a location with decent signal strength .
updating firmware[-1][v] ## Only issue is with updating firmware .
speed[-1] ## The problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around 72MB\/s , even when in the same room .
work[-1][v] ## Unfortunately , I just could not get it to work .
support[-1] ## D-Link support was polite and tried to help , but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful .
Ethernet transceiver[-1] ## I conclude that the Ethernet transceiver D-Link uses is not as good as that of other brands .
connection[-1] ## The connection is not reliable and constantly dropped .
tech support[-1] ## I called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware , but this did not solve the problem .
product[-1] ## They said the product was defective and said they would send a new one .
product[-1] ## I am disappointed in this product .
SharePort Utility[-1] ## In that regard , I am still having difficulty attempting to get the SharePort Utility to function normally .
router[-1] ## More than likely , if you are forking over the money for this router , you have higher needs and expectations , which this router does n't meet .
guest network[-1] ## Well the theory was great , but upon enabling the guest network , things stopped working .
GUI[-1] ## With it enabled , anytime we made changes to the router , we had to manually press the `` turn on radio '' button on the front of the router because the GUI one would n't work .
USB Network storage[-1] ## USB Network storage - `` supposedly '' it 's slow .
router[-1] ## I 'd tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so I never got far enough to try this .
slow[-1][a] ## I was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow .
SLOW[-1][a] ## SLOW GUI - Be prepared to wait approximately 90 seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded `` apply '' button ... yes , 1�1\/2 minutes !
download[-1][v], run[-1][v] ## Slow to download and run certain programs Wish you the best and hope my review helped !
screen[-1], picture quality[-1] ## When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .
support[-1], router[-1] ## Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .
firmware[-1] ## Or maybe Netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does n't know what to do .
slowed down[-1][v] ## This router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed IPTV from Hulu Plus would slow down and freeze or stutter .
labeling of firmware[-1] ## The labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires .
product[-1] ## I wanted the product to work soo bad , but it just did n't .
connection speeds[+1], reception[+1], connection[-1] ## I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .
dlink support[-1] ## I gave up after several attempts to contact dlink support .
product[-1] ## Simply this product was created and was left behind !
product[-1] ## I guess I do n't have to mention that I do not recommend this product , that I most likely will return it and keep my fingers off Cisco\/Linksys stuff in future .
router[-1] ## The router has obviously problems with static IP addresses , firewalls and numerous other programs .
installation software[-1] ## Unfortunately , the installation software crashed several times and I had to reboot my Vista PC at least twice -- not fun .
instructions[-1] ## Meanwhile , the instructions for Apple users indicated I should load the CD-ROM , but it turns out it only contained a PDF of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for Apple computers .
product[-1] ## Exasperated at 3 AM , I called it quits and will be sending this awful , deceptive product back .
internet connection[-1] ## Everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically .
router[-1] ## The new router worked well for 2 months after which it had failed .
router[-1], connection[-1] ## I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .
router[-1] ## Its annoying when you pay $ 100 + for a router and it does n't work as it is supposed straight out of the box !
quality[-1], customer service[-1] ## I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .
device[-1], customer service[-1] ## All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .
Worked[+1][v], firmware[-1] ## Worked great until the new firmware that installs SecureSpot .
working[-1][v] ## When the SecureSpot free trial finishes , they ask you to buy it and when you do n't , it stops working well .
SecureSpot[-1] ## Even when you disable SecureSpot completely , it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is n't and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized .
upgrade[-1] ## You ca n't , that `` upgrade '' is irreversible .
D-Link[-1], product[-1] ## D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .
Linksys[-1] ## My Linksys froze for 30 minutes or longer when applying changes .
works[+1][v], performance[-1] ## It works fine but performance is no better than my old SMC G 54mbs .
speed[-1] ## First thing I tested was the speed , and I have to say it was abysmal .
speed[-1] ## Hooked up to the D-Link extreme N , connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps .
internet connection[-1] ## The next day , I turned on my laptop and it connected to the network , but no internet connection .
external switch[-1] ## I do n't think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end , you have to learn how to identify IP addresses , switch the router from from a dynamic to static IP address , and assign a static IP address that is compatible with your router or modem .
setup software[-1] ## SETUP SOFTWARE - For my application , I found the setup software on the enclosed CD to be useless .
wait[-1][v] ## Be prepared for a long wait -LRB- 30-45 minutes -RRB- , but the wait was worth it .
software[-1], internet user manual[-1] ## If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .
dd-wrt software[-1] ## I only give it 4 stars because the device came with really old dd-wrt software .
netgear genie tool[-1] ## WITHOUT having to go through the netgear genie tool through the ISP and taking all the extra steps would be far better .
remote[-1] ## The only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight .
sound quality[-1] ## The sound quality has been poor since day one , the base constantly drops calls , and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base -- we can no longer use the AC adapter with the base or it turns off completely .
volume[-1] ## The incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers -LRB- it was so bad I had my hearing tested because I thought something was wrong with me .
noise[-1] ## I tried to use these with my laptop -LRB- Dell Inspiron 1720 -RRB- but could n't get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned , no matter how far I moved them from the computer or where I plugged them in .
cord[-1] ## My only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough .
stands[-1], speakers[-1] ## One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .
speakers[+1], Volume adjustment[-1] ## Pros : - Big crisp screen 1920x1080 resolution - Under $ 200 - Decent sounding speakers Cons : Volume adjustment is a little annoying but not really a big problem since windows has volume controls .
dsub cord[-1] ## The main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short .
heavy[-1][a] ## That and for the center speaker , when I mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall .
heavy[-1][a] ## They are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be .
cross-ship[-1][v] ## They offered to replace my controller but -- important to note -- they were unwilling to cross-ship it .
Klipsh subwoofer[-1] ## The Klipsh subwoofer is laughable .
sound[-1] ## Initially the sound was low and sounded `` off '' .
remote control[-1], reciever[-1] ## The remote control and reciever not so good .
buttons[-1] ## The buttons are confusing and super small .
look[+1][v], quality issue[-1] ## They look cool but they have a quality issue for sure ... hit or miss I guess , a gamble for sure !
volumn[-1] ## I wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder .
range of response[-1] ## The range of response seems a little limited to me -LRB- changing the EQ setting on the iPod produces a definite change in the sound , but I would expect a little more richness in the changes -RRB- .
speaker wire[-1] ## The only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin .
Instructions[-1], instructions manual[-1] ## You can also use a 6v DC power supply -LRB- not included -RRB- Cons : - Bad Instructions ; like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and , in this case , erroneously lists the power requirements as AC when it should be DC .
volume[+1], vibration[-1], distortion[-1] ## The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .
incompatibility[-1] ## My biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my 2nd generation iPod Nano .
speakers[-1], tone side[-1] ## The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .
disconnects[-1][v] ## My only complaint is like others here ... it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it 's really annoying when it does because it does it so often .
volume[-1] ## While my laptop and netbook have decent speakers , the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers , making it harder to hear some audio .
quality item[-1], speaker[-1], sound[-1] ## Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .
definition sound[-1] ## It 's a fun little gadget , do n't expect high definition sound .
bass[+1], mids[-1] ## A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .
switch[-1] ## The switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the `` pulse '' is n't really all that but that is irrelevant to me .
look[-1][v] ## They do look cool in the dark though .
speakers[-1], preform[-1][v] ## I tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price .
sound[-1] ## If you want good sound , STAY AWAY !!!
quality[-1] ## I will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker .
tone[-1], speakers[-1] ## The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .
subwoofer[-1] ## The subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned ALL THE WAY DOWN , but it 's all right because these are computer speakers .
horn tweeters[-1] ## Some may not like the horn tweeters , as they tend to sound too hot .
horns[-1] ## I usually avoid horns but I do n't hear anything overly extreme .
tonal qualities[-1] ## What I do n't like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor .
speaker crossovers[-1] ## There are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built-in speaker crossovers .
mid-range[-1], bass[-1] ## You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .
components[-1] ## - Construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .
satellites[-1] ## Cons : - I think the satellites look ugly .
sub woofer[-1] ## - Ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up .
speakers[+1], adjustments[-1] ## While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .
speaker cable[-1] ## - Fixed speaker cable -- why do this ?
speakers[-1][a] ## Conclusion : I was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day I got them .
properties[-1] ## I 'm still very frustrated with some of the properties , but now that I have saved equalizer settings and know I have to open up my sound card 's control panel every time I switch between music and videos or games , the sound is much more acceptable .
speakers[-1], volume[-1] ## The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .
carpet tacks[-1] ## I have n't even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over .
drawings[-1] ## Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are n't that great .
bass[-1], system[-1] ## First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .
Mid-range[-1] ## Mid-range is n't the best , but it 's certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend $ 300 + on computer speakers .
bigger[-1][a] ## It is also a bit bigger than expected but that 's OK because all I need is something to work with my iphone .
bass[-1] ## I deducted a star because , when I put my iPod and iPad on full volume , the speaker 's bass began to completely ruin the sound .
design[-1] ## There are a few things that I do n't like about the design .
instructions[-1] ## The only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it .
viewing angle[-1] ## I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast .
repair team[-1] ## I should 've trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of Acer .
service[-1], support[-1] ## Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .
weight[+1], battery life[+1], keyboard[+1], screen[+1], heat up[+1][v], HDMI output[+1], local HD decoding[+1], audio volume[-1] ## Pros : Low weight , long battery life , decent keyboard , decent screen , does not heat up , HDMI output , flawless local HD decoding Con : low audio volume , just enough CPU power
Acer[-1] ## I was dissapointed that Acer was n't more helpful .
Netbook[+1], Customer service[-1] ## The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .
monitor[-1] ## 2 weeks later , The monitor start having other issues , only half screen turns on , or it become a full green screen and doesnt change , you need to turn it off and on again until it works .
bright[-1][a] ## In fact others say not bright enough ?
weight[-1] ## <p> It 's not lite on weight ... so sad ... I definately recommend it to anyone out there .
bright[-1][a] ## I find it too bright .
technical support[-1] ## Someday , your going to need support , and Acer 's technical support department is the next to worthless .
Sound[+1], size[-1] ## Sound is also nice as compared to its size .
backlight[-1] ## Now when the backlight fails , I have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day .
vga connection[-1] ## This means that the vga connection will not work with my computers .
quality of picture[-1], DVI Connection[+1], VGA Connection[-1] ## 3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .
speaker grill[-1] ## There is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .
material[-1], look[-1] ## Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .
sound[-1] ## The sound is far from good and there 's a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity .
material[-1] ## material is on the cheap side .
sound quality[+1], volume[-1] ## Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .
controls[-1] ## The controls are hard to see and not intuitive .
sound quality[-1] ## The sound quality is very poor .
sound[-1][v] ## However , since I am in an office , I normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak .
expensive[-1][a] ## Their products are super expensive , especially to get them fixed .
panel[-1] ## For my work this panel is unusable .
product[-1] ## This product did not work at all .
machine[-1], Acer[-1] ## I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .
Acer product[-1] ## I would not recommend this or any Acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex .
Expensive[-1][a] ## Expensive , but for us -- well worth it .
range[+1] ## It has very good range -- much better than the Linksys router it replaced .
firmware[+1], router[+1] ## It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .
range[+1], speed[+1] ## Good range & speed .
price[+1] ## The price was the lowest I 'd seen in my research -LRB- Best Buy , Office Depot -RRB- .
use[+1][v], instructions[+1] ## Easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive .
guest feature[+1] ## Also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link .
device[+1], looking[+1][a] ## It 's a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically .
Buffalo Technical Support line[+1] ## TECHNICAL SUPPORT LINE - The Buffalo Technical Support line on the other hand , was very helpful .
technical support[+1] ## The technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support 4 stars .
setup[-1], Bufflo Nfinity G300N[+1], access point[+1], range[+1] ## SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .

speakers[+1] ## If I were to rate these speakers on my listening needs , I would give a 2.5 stars , but I 'm giving 4 because I think they do the job that most people want them for .
computer speaker[+1] ## However , once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work I like to get done with some background music , viola , the audio is great -LRB- well , this is relative - great for a computer speaker -RRB- .

computer speaker[+1], bass[+1] ## - If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .
speakers[+1] ## This is a preference , but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels , I 'd be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less ... redolent of a teenager 's car system .
Sub woofer[+1] ## - Sub woofer is large .
computer speaker[+1] ## For those who want the thump that this is capable of producing -LRB- very good for a computer speaker -RRB- , this is probably necessary .

works[+1][v], sound[+1], size[+1], price[+1] ## I got it today , it works great , great sound for its size and price , I understand that the volume for iPhone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so I do n't complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iPhone , I highly recommend this tower .
sound[+1][v] ## They sound wonderful , in my opinion , and I have n't even touched any equalizers .

loud[+1][a] ## My brother and I were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is .
sound[+1] ## The sound became instantly clear again .
