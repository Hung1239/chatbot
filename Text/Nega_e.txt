Expensive[-1][a] ## Expensive , but for us -- well worth it .
sound[-1][v] ## However , since I am in an office , I normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak .
expensive[-1][a] ## Their products are super expensive , especially to get them fixed .
panel[-1] ## For my work this panel is unusable .
product[-1] ## This product did not work at all .
machine[-1], Acer[-1] ## I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .
Acer product[-1] ## I would not recommend this or any Acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex .
sound quality[+1], volume[-1] ## Really good sound quality , but certainly not high fidelity , and volume is not at all blaring .
controls[-1] ## The controls are hard to see and not intuitive .
sound[-1] ## The sound is far from good and there 's a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity .
bright[-1][a] ## In fact others say not bright enough ?
weight[-1] ## <p> It 's not lite on weight ... so sad ... I definately recommend it to anyone out there .
bright[-1][a] ## I find it too bright .
technical support[-1] ## Someday , your going to need support , and Acer 's technical support department is the next to worthless .
Sound[+1], size[-1] ## Sound is also nice as compared to its size .
backlight[-1] ## Now when the backlight fails , I have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day .
vga connection[-1] ## This means that the vga connection will not work with my computers .
quality of picture[-1], DVI Connection[+1], VGA Connection[-1] ## 3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .
speaker grill[-1] ## There is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .
material[-1], look[-1] ## Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .
design[-1] ## There are a few things that I do n't like about the design .
instructions[-1] ## The only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it .
viewing angle[-1] ## I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast .
repair team[-1] ## I should 've trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of Acer .
service[-1], support[-1] ## Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .
weight[+1], battery life[+1], keyboard[+1], screen[+1], heat up[+1][v], HDMI output[+1], local HD decoding[+1], audio volume[-1] ## Pros : Low weight , long battery life , decent keyboard , decent screen , does not heat up , HDMI output , flawless local HD decoding Con : low audio volume , just enough CPU power
Acer[-1] ## I was dissapointed that Acer was n't more helpful .
Netbook[+1], Customer service[-1] ## The Netbook is great and rates 5 stars EXCEPT -- Customer service is useless .
monitor[-1] ## 2 weeks later , The monitor start having other issues , only half screen turns on , or it become a full green screen and doesnt change , you need to turn it off and on again until it works .
Mid-range[-1] ## Mid-range is n't the best , but it 's certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend $ 300 + on computer speakers .
bigger[-1][a] ## It is also a bit bigger than expected but that 's OK because all I need is something to work with my iphone .
drawings[-1] ## Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are n't that great .
speakers[-1], volume[-1] ## The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .
speakers[-1][a] ## Conclusion : I was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day I got them .
speakers[+1], adjustments[-1] ## While these speakers are capable of sounding good , I have to do more adjustments every time I change media type to keep it from sounding bad .
sub woofer[-1] ## - Ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up .
components[-1] ## - Construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .
mid-range[-1], bass[-1] ## You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .
tonal qualities[-1] ## What I do n't like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor .
tone[-1], speakers[-1] ## The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .
subwoofer[-1] ## The subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned ALL THE WAY DOWN , but it 's all right because these are computer speakers .
horn tweeters[-1] ## Some may not like the horn tweeters , as they tend to sound too hot .
look[-1][v] ## They do look cool in the dark though .
speakers[-1], preform[-1][v] ## I tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price .
sound[-1] ## If you want good sound , STAY AWAY !!!
quality[-1] ## I will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker .
definition sound[-1] ## It 's a fun little gadget , do n't expect high definition sound .
bass[+1], mids[-1] ## A little bit of control over the mids would be nice but the bass is solid for the size .
volume[-1] ## While my laptop and netbook have decent speakers , the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers , making it harder to hear some audio .
speakers[-1], tone side[-1] ## The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .
range of response[-1] ## The range of response seems a little limited to me -LRB- changing the EQ setting on the iPod produces a definite change in the sound , but I would expect a little more richness in the changes -RRB- .
buttons[-1] ## The buttons are confusing and super small .
remote control[-1], reciever[-1] ## The remote control and reciever not so good .
heavy[-1][a] ## They are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be .
cross-ship[-1][v] ## They offered to replace my controller but -- important to note -- they were unwilling to cross-ship it .
heavy[-1][a] ## That and for the center speaker , when I mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall .
stands[-1], speakers[-1] ## One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .
cord[-1] ## My only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough .
netgear genie tool[-1] ## WITHOUT having to go through the netgear genie tool through the ISP and taking all the extra steps would be far better .
software[-1], internet user manual[-1] ## If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .
wait[-1][v] ## Be prepared for a long wait -LRB- 30-45 minutes -RRB- , but the wait was worth it .
external switch[-1] ## I do n't think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end , you have to learn how to identify IP addresses , switch the router from from a dynamic to static IP address , and assign a static IP address that is compatible with your router or modem .
works[+1][v], performance[-1] ## It works fine but performance is no better than my old SMC G 54mbs .
Worked[+1][v], firmware[-1] ## Worked great until the new firmware that installs SecureSpot .
working[-1][v] ## When the SecureSpot free trial finishes , they ask you to buy it and when you do n't , it stops working well .
router[-1] ## Its annoying when you pay $ 100 + for a router and it does n't work as it is supposed straight out of the box !
quality[-1], customer service[-1] ## I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .
internet connection[-1] ## Everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically .
router[-1] ## The new router worked well for 2 months after which it had failed .
product[-1] ## I guess I do n't have to mention that I do not recommend this product , that I most likely will return it and keep my fingers off Cisco\/Linksys stuff in future .
dlink support[-1] ## I gave up after several attempts to contact dlink support .
connection[-1] ## The connection is not reliable and constantly dropped .
support[-1], router[-1] ## Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .
screen[-1], picture quality[-1] ## When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .
download[-1][v], run[-1][v] ## Slow to download and run certain programs Wish you the best and hope my review helped !
router[-1] ## I 'd tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so I never got far enough to try this .
GUI[-1] ## With it enabled , anytime we made changes to the router , we had to manually press the `` turn on radio '' button on the front of the router because the GUI one would n't work .
SharePort Utility[-1] ## In that regard , I am still having difficulty attempting to get the SharePort Utility to function normally .
signal strength[-1] ## Unfortunately my Verizon 3G signal strength where I live is very weak -LRB- 1-2 bars -RRB- so I could n't get much more than 1 Mbps download speed but I will test this again when I am in a location with decent signal strength .
updating firmware[-1][v] ## Only issue is with updating firmware .
speed[-1] ## The problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around 72MB\/s , even when in the same room .
work[-1][v] ## Unfortunately , I just could not get it to work .
support[-1] ## D-Link support was polite and tried to help , but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful .
Ethernet transceiver[-1] ## I conclude that the Ethernet transceiver D-Link uses is not as good as that of other brands .
firmware upgrade[-1] ## halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar , the infamous browser `` Page not found '' screen replaced most of the router 's interface .
